# ☀️ Solar Potential Analysis – Benin, Sierra Leone & Togo

This project explores solar radiation data to identify the most promising country for solar investment. Data profiling, cleaning, EDA, and statistical testing were performed.

## 🔧 Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each country + comparison
- `src/`: Modular Python scripts for cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets (not committed)
- `tests/`: Placeholder for unit testing

## 📊 Methodology

1. Data Cleaning (outliers, missing values)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Statistical Testing (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis)
4. Cross-country comparison
5. Visualization (bar charts, correlation, time series)

## 🚀 Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-potential-analysis.git
cd solar-potential-analysis
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # or `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows
